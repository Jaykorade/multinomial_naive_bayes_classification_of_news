If Clinton does pull out a win, it ends Sanders' streak and all but guarantees Clinton's nomination. If, on the other hand, Sanders should narrowly win, it doesn't mean he wins the nomination -- the two will split New York's delegates almost evenly.

And it would put the remaining states, most notably Pennsylvania and California, seriously in play. Even with a close win for Clinton in New York, the risk for Democrats is that Clinton limps towards nomination, while the preponderance of energy and excitement are with Sanders."

But on Friday, after worsening an already bad bill by weakening protections for the children at the center of the crisis, they finally passed a symbolic and useless package -- useless since their Republican counterparts in the Senate already torpedoed that chamber's $2.7 billion border crisis bill.

It capped a week of nightly disarray - with Trump more than living up to the ""chaos candidate"" title given to him by Jeb Bush. But what shone through the most in his endless and largely shouted speech was fear - fear of immigrants, fear of diversity, fear of the nation America has become. The key refrain was ""again,"" with Trump promising to make America ""strong again,"" ""proud again,"" ""safe again."" Never mind that America is actually, for instance, very safe - despite recent upticks, crime is still at historic lows. Trump the builder was building a sinister vision of a lost Eden, one that's been taken away by the scary, dangerous Other. And his calls for unity were unity by removal of the other. Trump has rebranded America as a dark, hostile, pessimistic, fearful place. And he only wins by building that place in our minds. But, to paraphrase FDR, we have nothing to fear but the manipulation and cynical nurturing of fear. Trump is, in essence, shorting America. That's his bet.

The events immediately provided a test for Republicans, some of whom rose to the occasion and refused to endorse Trump. Then there was Rick Perry, who once called Trump a ""cancer."" Now? He says he'd consider being his running mate: ""I will be open to any way I can help. I'm not going to say no."" What stirring statesmanship. But this is not just a test for the GOP. It's also a test for the media, who, as David Roberts writes, is likely to give a very unusual campaign the usual media treatment: ""Trump's obvious unfitness for office -- today widely acknowledged across both parties and in the mainstream media -- will become a partisan observation."" So, yes, as the media writes about how various Republicans are handling their character test, we need to remember we're facing one ourselves. The most important mistake the media could make now would be to treat this like a normal election, and Donald Trump like a normal candidate."
